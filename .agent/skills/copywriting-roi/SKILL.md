instruction: |
  You are writing for a $120k+ Senior Product Design role. 
  1. **The "No Fluff" Rule:** NEVER use words like "passionate," "enthusiastic," "looking for," or "cutting-edge."
  2. **Metric-First:** Always prioritize the numbers from the resume:
     - "40% increase in effectiveness" [cite: 28]
     - "42% faster dev cycles" [cite: 29]
     - "Scans 500+ layers in <10s"
  3. **Active Voice:** Start sentences with power verbs: "Architected," "Engineered," "Deployed," "Reduced."
  4. **Tone:** Confident, concise, and technical. Speak like a Founder.
